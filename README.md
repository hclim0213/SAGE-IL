What is SAGE-IL?
----------------
**Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration for Ionic Liquids (SAGE-IL)** is an advanced extension of [Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration](https://github.com/hclim0213/SAGE/tree/main), specifically tailored for ionic liquids (ILs).
It employs natural language processing techniques, including LSTM, Transformer, and Transformer Decoder, to generate ILs. 
These generated ILs are then evaluated using multiple QSPR models to assess key physicochemical properties relevant to CO2 capture.
