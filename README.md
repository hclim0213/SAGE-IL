What is SAGE-IL?
----------------
**Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration for Ionic Liquids (SAGE-IL)** is the extended version of Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration ([SAGE](https://github.com/hclim0213/SAGE/tree/main)) for ionic liquids (ILs) by generating ILs through nautural language processing techniques (LSTM, Transformer, and Transformer Decoder) and evaluating them with multiple QSPR models for key physicochemical properties relevant to CO2 capture.
